# Tranquilizer
A Python app that employs a CNN for the purpose of denoising images. 
It contains a user-friendly GUI for opening, denoising and saving images.
It also contains a CLI for training additional models. A collection of satisfactory, pre-trained models is included.

## Origin
Tranquilizer and the research done with it make up my credit project for my Introduction to Computer Intelligence course.
